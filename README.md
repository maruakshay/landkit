Hello Reader,


I have made a replica of the project you send me. There are few styling left but i have made react based app/ site. 

Workings :

in the form i have made a download sample .. write name mail and password , when click the button will say no and then no data can be stored after. the user is stored in the array and made json so that it can travel to the front end and backend. 

Tried to make it responsive and added animations , most of it are custom css through but i wanted to add a handy animation so used animate.css

There are components which uses props to define the data 



WISH YOU A HAPPY DAY ........!
